Axioms is a library of _small_ composable functions, providing functional programming functionality to regular typescript code.

Writing typesafe code shouldn't be hard. However, writing generic functions to do so _is_. Axioms do the hard work for you. The library is entirely tree shakeable and small as we can make it.

## [Documentation](https://skyleague.github.io/axioms/)

The documentation can be found [here](https://skyleague.github.io/axioms/).

## Installation

Install Axioms using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```console
 $ npm install @skyleague/axioms
```

## Alternative projects

In no particular order, the following libraries try to solve similar problems (albeit very different):

-   [`Lodash`](https://github.com/lodash/lodash); works very well but defines a more polymorphic interface than we'd like. Also, tree-shaking is difficult without using different versions of this library.
-   [`Rambda`](https://ramdajs.com/)
-   The list goes on...

PR's are very welcome if you think your project is missing here.
